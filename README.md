project 1 of deep learning course im following concerning MNIST Neural Network Training

Overview:
This script demonstrates training neural networks on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It covers basic model creation, experimenting with different complexities, implementing early stopping, and exploring dropout layers for improved performance.

Contents:

Data Handling: Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
Simple Model Training: Trains a basic neural network.
Model Complexity Experiment: Analyzes model performance with varying learning rates.
Early Stopping: Implements early stopping during model training.
Dropout Usage: Explores dropout layers for enhanced model robustness.

Usage:

Install Python 3.x, PyTorch, and Matplotlib.
Run mnist_neural_network.py in a compatible Python environment.
Modify hyperparameters or model architectures for experimentation.
